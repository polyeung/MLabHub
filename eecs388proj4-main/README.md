Start by running `./build.sh` to set up your targets. It will prompt 
for uniqnames. Enter all uniqnames in your group, separated by spaces.
Each groupâ€™s targets will be slightly different, so make sure your
uniqnames are correct!

We've provided `test.sh` to help check that your solutions match
the spec. However, this script is not the autograder, and it is not
authoritative. The spec (and autograder) has a few requirements beyond
what the script verifies, and it's up to you to test carefully.
