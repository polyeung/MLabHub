Irradiated Materials Testing Laboratory
The Irradiated Material Testing Laboratory (IMTL) was established to provide a facility to conduct experimental research on neutron irradiated materials in aqueous environments. The IMTL consists of five refreshed autoclaves (Inconel & 316 Stainless Steel construction) that can be mounted in constant extension rate (CERT) or crack growth rate (CGR) configurations. This unique, one-of-a-kind research facility is currently the only one in the world capable of conducting experiments on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of neutron irradiated material in supercritical water. The lab also contains three direct current potential drop (DCPD) systems for controlling the load on the specimens while conducting crack growth rate (CGR) experiments, as well as a JOEL JSM-6480 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and EDAX EDS Element Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) with a silicon nitride (Si3N4) window for timely on-site analysis of specimens.
