Lab Name: BEEHome, MichiganBehavioralandExperimentalEconomics
Brief Intro: Welcome to the University of Michigan’s BEELab! We are a group of behavioral economists from three units—the Economics Department, the Ross Business School, and the School of Information. Our research utilizes experiments in a physical laboratory, such as the Behavioral Research Lab in North Quad, or online. We also conduct field experiments in naturalistic settings to study how people make economic decisions. Our goal is to provide PhD students with an informal and collaborative environment where they can get feedback on their projects and develop their skills to succeed in the job market. We also run a weekly seminar series—the Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics or SBEESeminar Series.
