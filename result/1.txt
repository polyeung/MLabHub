Lab Name: Violi Lab
Brief Intro: Violi Lab is a research group at the University of Michigan focused on various aspects of combustion, including combustion pathway prediction, soot formation, and the development of surrogate fuels for transportation. The lab also conducts simulations of practical combustion devices and studies the dynamics of biological interfaces and membrane simulations. Led by Angela Violi, the lab aims to advance the understanding of combustion processes and contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient energy technologies.
