Lab Name: Heat Transfer Physics Lab
Brief Intro: The Heat Transfer Physics Lab, led by Professor Massoud Kaviany, focuses on research related to heat transfer phenomena. The lab investigates various topics such as numerical methods in heat transfer with phase-change, condensation in porous media, and diffusion-reaction in multi-length scale porous media. The lab also explores applications in areas such as fuel cells, combustion, and thermoelectricity. With a team of current lab members and a history of successful alumni, the Heat Transfer Physics Lab continues to contribute to the field of heat transfer physics.
