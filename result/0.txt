Lab Name: Tech Culture Matters Research Collective
Brief Intro: The Tech Culture Matters Research Collective at the University of Michigan is a multi-sited research collective focused on studying the social, technological, political, and material processes of contemporary technology. Their research involves deep ethnographic engagements in diverse regions such as the American Midwest, China, Indonesia, Africa, and Europe. They employ a range of methodologies including ethnography, critical inquiry, research through design, discourse analysis, electronic arts, and critical making. Their interdisciplinary work contributes to fields such as Science and Technology Studies, Human-computer interaction, Cultural Anthropology, Digital Media & Communication Studies, Southeast Asian Studies, China Studies, African Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies. The collective partners with makers, designers, artists, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and industrial producers to create alternative spaces and understandings of technology and its relation to identity, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, work, and labor.
