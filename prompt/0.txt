  "main_response": "Lab Name: Michigan Center for Materials Characterization (MC)2\nBrief Intro: The Michigan Center for Materials Characterization (MC)2 is the University of Michigan's facility dedicated to the micron and nanoscale imaging and analysis of materials. Located in Building 22 of the North Campus Research Complex, (MC)2 provides state-of-the-art instruments, professional training, and in-depth education for students, researchers, academic institutions, and local industry. With a diverse user base of over 450 users, (MC)2 supports a wide range of disciplines and research groups. The center has recently acquired advanced instruments such as the ThermoFisher Spectra300 Probe Cs-corrected S/TEM, ThermoFisher Helios G4 PFIB UXe, and ThermoFisher Talos F200XG2, enhancing its capabilities in imaging and analysis. (MC)2 also collaborates with the Michigan Ion Beam Lab (MIBL) to provide unique opportunities for in-situ irradiation studies.",

The center, housed in Building 22 of the North Campus Research Complex, provides state-of-the-art instruments, professional training, and in-depth education for students and other internal researchers, fellow academic institutions, and local industry.\u00a0(MC)2 supports a diverse multi-disciplinary user base of more than 450 users from various colleges and departments, 100+ internal research groups, and over 20 non-academic companies.\u00a0Instrumentation UpdatesWe have recently installed a Thermo Fisher Spectra 300 Probe Cs-corrected S/TEM, featuring high resolution STEM imaging, ultrafast elemental mapping, high energy resolution monochromated EELS, and 4D-STEM. We will soon open access for experienced TEM users.Prior to this, the Center acquired a Thermo Fisher\u00a0Helios G4 PFIB UXe, a high-resolution SEM with an Xe plasma focused ion beam, and a Thermo Fisher Talos F200X G2, a 200 kV FEG scanning transmission electron microscope (S/TEM).(MC)2 is collaborating with the Michigan Ion Beam Lab (MIBL) in providing unique opportunities for in-situ irradiation studies using the Thermo Fisher Tecnai G2 F30 TWIN, a 300 kV transmission electron microscope interfaced with a particle accelerator and a low energy ion source. Two separate ion species can be combined for delivery to the TEM stage. This experimental setup makes University of Michigan one of only a few locations in the U.S. to offer an ion beam and electron beam combination: see more information here.\u00a0The center has also upgraded the camera on the JEOL 3100R05 microscope to a Gatan K2, facilitating in-situ imaging, fast acquisition video recording, and low-dose electron energy loss spectroscopy.Quick LinksBecome a UserInstrument SchedulingOther FacilitiesContact StaffMichigan Center for Materials Characterization mc2-staff@umich.eduNCRC B22, Rm G011, 2800 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor MI 48109Michigan Engineering  1221 Beal Ave. Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2102 +1 (734) 647-7000  Contact the College  Engineering Intranet \u00a9 2023The Regents of the University of Michigan  |  Safety Information | Acceptable Use |Privacy Policy  |U-M MainLogin | Logout",
